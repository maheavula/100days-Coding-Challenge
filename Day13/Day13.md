# 🖥️ 100 Days of Code Challenge

Welcome to my **100 Days of Code Challenge**! 🎯 In this journey, I will be coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days. This repository tracks my daily progress with problem statements, solutions, and reflections. 

Feel free to follow along and hold me accountable! 😊

---

## 📋 Rules & Goals
1. Code for **at least 1 hour every day** for the next 100 days.
2. **Log progress daily** in this README.
3. Explore new topics, **solve problems**, and **build projects**.
4. Share insights, roadblocks, and lessons learned.
5. Push all code and solutions to this repository.

## 🗂️ Repository Structure


Each day's folder contains:
- **README.md**: Description of the problem statement and any notes/reflections.
- **solution.py** (or relevant files): The solution or project built that day.
