# 100 Days of Coding Challenge - TalentBattle Platform

Welcome to my **100 Days of Coding Challenge** repository! 🎯

I have embarked on this journey with **TalentBattle**, where I will solve **one coding problem every day** for the next 100 days. These problems will range from **basic coding** to **advanced Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**, and I'll be solving them using **Python**.

## What you’ll find here:
- 📝 **Problem Statement**: The daily coding challenge problem.
- 💡 **Solution**: My Python solution.
- 📈 **Progress Tracker**: My streak of consistency and progress throughout the challenge.
